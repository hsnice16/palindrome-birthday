# palindrome-birthday

This app will tell a user that his/her birthday is palindrome or not. 

This app takes user birthday as input, and then checks their birthday in 4 formats dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, mm-dd-yy, and yyyy-mm-dd. And if it is a palindrome in any format, then it will show a message with the format in which it is palindrome. 

And If not, then tell them what is the nearest date from their birthdate which is a palindrome date. And also tell them by how many days they missed it.

**What is a Palindrome?**
A palindrome is a word/number which reads the same backward as forward
